Client wants a database to be created where he can save his store's data, run business queries to make data driven decisions. 
Client also instructed to established relationships among tables, apply  constraints, create procedures and triggers and whichever way possible optimize the database for optimal performances. 
 
Client has given a set of 30+ questions to be answered as a part of data analysis stage. 
As discussed with the client, with this information, client wants to be able to make informed decisions about products and customers.
